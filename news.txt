<li>I just got back from a 90 minute SiN Deathmatch which I won. Pictures on the new SiN page. This game is damn wicked. It is so, because it is based off a modified Quake2 engine. Alleluia, the makers of SiN actually chose the right engine instead of the retards at Duke Nukem Forever and their choice of the Unreal engine. Everyone must get this game when it comes out. GRRRRREEEAT!<p>
<li>ClanGDI would like to welcome yet another new member: Serpentor. This guy challenged our leader, PhantomRun, and actually almost beat him. He will clearly be a great asset to this clan. Welcome brotha!<p>
<li>I am learning to mouse look finally. Please don't laugh when u play against or with me, because I am <u>learning</u> but I must say, after playing 90 minutes of SiN, I have greatly improved. If u are still keyboarding, get on the mouse now baby, you'll be much better. Trust Scar45...trust him...he's right.<p>
<li>We also have a match coming up against Clan DS soon. More details will be posted as soon as we find out what the hell is going on.<p>

<li>Well, ClanGDI would like to welcome back one of its initial members: Dominion2. He is back and better and badder than ever. Welcome back brotha!<p>
<li>I have learned to mouse look. One of the greatest assets a Quake player could ever have. I can't believe I waited this long!<p>
<li>The SiN Demo came out over at <a href="http://www.ritualistic.com">Ritualistic's Website</a>. Damn, this is one amazing game, considering it uses a modified Quake2 ENGINE. Think of it as a more social or everyday life Quake (banks, robbers, not machines/robots). Although the demo is a hefty 33MB, its well worth it. Hell, I got a 33.6KBps and I went for it.<p>

<li>Wow, just realized that I usually end up workin' on the page late at night ;)<p>
<li>ClanGDI recently had a match against <a href="/or/ColdFyre">Clan ColdFyre </a>and well, we came close, but no cigar. These guys however, like to brag, and I thought I'd give y'all the link so you can go check out their webmaster's lack of HTML knowledge. We don't really have any lamers, but these guys come close. Stay tuned for a rematch.<font color="gray">CF-C3I3$Ta sux</font color><p>
<li>Not much new news, but if you look in the top-right corner of the page, I have added a new graphic which will tell when me and PhantomRun are Online/Offline. It's from ICQ and if for some reason you don't have ICQ, go get it at <a href="http://www.icq.com">ICQ.com</a><p>

Deathmatch which I won. Pictures on the new SiN page. This game
is damn wicked. It is so, because it is based off a modified
Quake2 engine. Alleluia, the makers of SiN actually chose the
right engine instead of the retards at Duke Nukem Forever and
their choice of the Unreal engine. Everyone must get this game
when it comes out. GRRRRREEEAT!</b></font></p>

don't laugh when u play against or with me, because I am </b><b><u>learning</u></b><b>

improved. If u are still keyboarding, get on the mouse now baby,
you'll be much better. Trust Scar45...trust him...he's right.</b></font></p>

amazing game, considering it uses a modified Quake2 ENGINE. Think

undergone huge renovations, or changes...Me and PhantomRun were
playing in a clan match (we won had no help from our own
&quot;members&quot;) and we had a revelation. Since I do ALL of
the work on this page, and PhantomRun is our strongest Quake
player, we have decided to clear everyone and start over. If
there are former GDI members who wish to stay in the clan, they
must tryout again. If there are others, they are welcome too. Now
granted we aren't super strict with our policies, but a clan is a
clan and we must stick together and support each other by playing
together. Hell, I haven't even played with anyone other than
Dominion2 and Stalker, and Stalker left the clan a while ago...I
don't know the other guys that were my &quot;Clan Partners&quot;.
So, if you wish to tryout, drop me a message via ICQ and tell me.

# ClanGDI Homepage
## Guerilla Defensive Intelligence
---
Our Quake 2 clan from way, WAY back in the day. This was literally the first website I ever built, frames intact, during the summer of 1998.

### Some fun code snippets:

```
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage Express 2.0`">

<bgsound src="trooper.mid" loop="infinite">
```

### ...and a warning from my IDE nowadays:

```
Some files contain problems.
9 errors and 1,001 warnings found.

Would you like to review them?
```
### Demos

Note that the demos under the [Downloads] section actually still work, well, 2 of them. I tested and literally saw myself playing Quake 2 from nearly 20 years ago. Nostalgia hits hard sometimes.

### What's been edited since

- Fixed paths to make it work ofc, but left all in the root because no time to QA each page
- Note that my "Webmaster" e-mail account no longer exists
- Popped in a Github link on the left frame (haha...frame(!!))

#### Hope you enjoyed taking a trip back to the (ugly, frameset-ed) past! Don't judge my skills nowadays on this code though!
